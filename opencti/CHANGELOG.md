## Version 3.0.0 (19/02/2020)
Dear OpenCTI community, we are proud to announce the release of OpenCTI version 3.0.0. This version is a turning point in the OpenCTI roadmap, as we worked hard on the following objective: allow you to deploy OpenCTI in production within your organization with the right level of security and the expected stability and performances, turn OpenCTI into an enterprise-grade product.

One of the most important enhancement in this version is the implementation of the RBAC system, associated to 3 new authentication strategies (LDAP/AD, OpenID, etc.). You are now able to create roles and assign roles to users to grant them capabilities (read knowledge, update knowledge, import, manage accesses, etc.). The other feature is about reports and data. The import/export system is now stable (with the observed-data management) and we improved again the performances of write operations. We also speeded-up a lot a views (report knowledge graph, listing of some relationships, etc.). 

A lot of improvements not related to the main features of this release have been made. We published a [new connector](https://github.com/OpenCTI-Platform/connectors/tree/master/import-file-pdf-observables) to analyze and extract IOCs from PDF files thanks to a member of our community. Many bugfixes on the API and the frontend, new content in the documentation and the creation of the [virtual machine template](https://opencti-platform.github.io/docs/installation/auto) hosting the whole stack for testing purposes. As we prepare a lot of new enrichment connectors for observables, we introduced the max TLP option to avoid leaking sensitive information. Other knowledge connectors will be soon published: AlienVault, CrowdStrike, TheHive, and other vendors.

In a few days, we will send you a message with the date of our first webinar, during which we will present how the platform could be used in different types of organization. As we often say, it is just the beginning of an exciting adventure, with soon much more community activities, data management, intelligent subsystems, visualizations and investigations capabilities.

## Version 2.1.4 (29/01/2020)
OpenCTI 2.1.4 has been released! This version hotfixes 4 bugs and introduces some technical enhancements in the migration system (no more errors when launching a fresh platform). We also fixed 2 bugs in the [Python library](https://github.com/OpenCTI-Platform/client-python) that impacted the import of vulnerabilities through the CVE connector. Thank you to all community members who reported these bugs. We will now focus on the next milestone: workspaces, outputs and the full support of LDAP/SSO with roles and permissions (read only, read write, etc.).

#### Enhancements:

- [#445](https://github.com/OpenCTI-Platform/opencti/issues/445) Fresh platform should not apply migrations

## Version 2.1.3 (24/01/2020)
Dear community, OpenCTI version 2.1.3 has been released! We mainly focused our work on the stability of the whole product as well as the resolution of some major bugs. However, several new features have also been implemented, in particular the possibility of exporting lists of entities in STIX2 or CSV format: exporting campaign indicators, reports about an intrusion sets, all malwares, etc. We have completed the refactoring of the Python library and added all the methods that were still missing on some entity types as well as the file upload feature. For the next release, we will carry on our huge refactor of workspaces and statistics in general. We also plan to conduct a documentation working session to improve it in depth.

Last but not least, we will soon plan the organization of a webinar that will be didicated to OpenCTI basics but also a very interesting use case for both red teams and blue teams: how to put all knowledge about an incident in OpenCTI and replay it using [Caldera](https://github.com/mitre/caldera). Double advantage of such a scenario: the capitalization of knowledge related to the incident as well as the ability to test the reaction of SOC / CSIRT in the event of a similar attack. Your feedback and your impressions are precious, do not hesitate to send us your use cases and the difficulties you encounter!

## Version 2.1.2 (21/12/2019)
Dear community, the OpenCTI platform version 2.1.2 has been released! This version provides users of the platform with many new features that will allow them to better modelize their CTI knowledge. We have resolved the gap that existed between the OpenCTI data model and the STIX2 schema by definitively separating the concepts of [observables](https://demo.opencti.io/dashboard/signatures/observables) and [indicators](https://demo.opencti.io/dashboard/signatures/indicators). It is now possible to create indicator in various formats: STIX Pattern, Snort, Sigma, YARA, etc.

All graphics and visuals are now based on ElasticSearch queries to increase performance. This will allow us to completely rework the workspaces and make them real monitoring tools in the next release. Also we have disabled all inferences rules on the platform by default, so a [very important screen](https://demo.opencti.io/dashboard/settings/inferences) has been added to the settings section, allowing users to enable inferences rules if they really need it. The MISP connector has been fully refactored and a [documentation is available](https://github.com/OpenCTI-Platform/connectors/tree/master/misp). Finally, we have added [many examples](https://github.com/OpenCTI-Platform/client-python/tree/master/examples) to the Python library.

#### Enhancements:

- [#383](https://github.com/OpenCTI-Platform/opencti/issues/383) Improve performance by using Elastic when searching for relations (when we can)
- [#375](https://github.com/OpenCTI-Platform/opencti/issues/375) Enhance display of relations and separate inferred/not inferred
- [#366](https://github.com/OpenCTI-Platform/opencti/issues/366) Use ElasticSearch for all statistics (timeseries, distribution, etc.)
- [#349](https://github.com/OpenCTI-Platform/opencti/issues/349) Enhance loaders/spinners everywhere
- [#335](https://github.com/OpenCTI-Platform/opencti/issues/335) Detection rules (yara, snort, suricata, sigma, etc)
- [#316](https://github.com/OpenCTI-Platform/opencti/issues/316) Split indicator/observable concepts, create indicators from observables 
- [#162](https://github.com/OpenCTI-Platform/opencti/issues/162) Refactor the observables schema to match STIX2 references
- [#145](https://github.com/OpenCTI-Platform/opencti/issues/145) Enable/disable inferences rules in settings
- [#58](https://github.com/OpenCTI-Platform/opencti/issues/58) Observables : expiration date
- [#57](https://github.com/OpenCTI-Platform/opencti/issues/57) Observables : scoring/rating

#### Bug Fixes:

- [#369](https://github.com/OpenCTI-Platform/opencti/issues/369) Store the remote IDs in some ES entities is useless and performance killer

---

## Version 2.1.1 (07/12/2019)
OpenCTI 2.1.1 has been released! This version is hotfixing 5 bugs (4 in the API/Frontend and 1 in the Python library) found after the last release. Thank you to all people who reported these bugs so we can now work on the next milestone. The next milestone will be focused on: improving performances of charts and relations display in the UI, development of many outputs and graphics (killchains, diamond model, PDF export of knowledge, full refactor/enhancement of workspaces, graph view of entities, comparison of threats TTPs/infrastructure and introduction of indicator concept.

#### Bug Fixes:

- [#364](https://github.com/OpenCTI-Platform/opencti/issues/364) Reindex can timeout on purging orphan relations
- [#363](https://github.com/OpenCTI-Platform/opencti/issues/363) Relation attributed-to cannot be created (bad direction)

## Version 2.1.0 (05/12/2019)
Dear community, the OpenCTI platform version 2.1.0 has been released! This version is an important step for the future developments of OpenCTI as a full Cyber Threat Intelligence product. We have worked on major issues and features directly linked to what you can expect from OpenCTI and what we need, as a developers team, to build a powerful and durable application. We have done a [lot of work on indexing in ElasticSearch](https://github.com/OpenCTI-Platform/opencti/pull/344) and in general all the way API methods are organized (removing more than 7K lines of useless source code). Ingestion and reading performance have been improved by 12x or by 20x in some cases.

We have also completed the data model and have introduced very useful features to allow you to fully modelize threats that may target your organization. You are now able to directly [link an observable on a relation "threat/incident => uses => TTP"](https://demo.opencti.io/dashboard/threats/incidents/c1640cb9-0644-4013-965a-67759e36ed0a/knowledge/relations/c1284679-7491-4de6-aebd-078580f4bcdc), for instance to indicate the registry key used for persistence or the sender email address of the phishing message. The attack patterns list has been reshaped to a [true killchain with the description of each relation](https://demo.opencti.io/dashboard/threats/intrusion_sets/a18c4ed1-4edf-4161-9a03-9727bb0f9c84/knowledge/ttp) to ensure a better understanding of analysts. Observables can now be linked together, allowing you for instance to [link hashes together](https://demo.opencti.io/dashboard/observables/all/e02b17dc-9092-44b3-b9d1-4d0be7de680e/links) if it corresponds to the same file, or link an IP address that resolves a domain name.

Last but not least, we have fully refactored the [Python library](https://github.com/OpenCTI-Platform/client-python) and started to write a proper documentation, you have now access to [many useful examples](https://github.com/OpenCTI-Platform/client-python/tree/master/examples) to interact with the OpenCTI platform in the Github repository. We will continue our efforts to make OpenCTI an indispensable tool for CTI, SOC and CSIRT teams around the world. We will soon publish usage and integration tips in existing workflows and plan a usecases-oriented webinar in January 2020.

## Version 2.0.2 (31/10/2019)
OpenCTI 2.0.2 has been released! This version is mainly focused on fixing bugs, one affecting the graph database that could trigger out of memory issues in Grakn and the other leading to lost data in the workers if the API is not available. Please stay tuned for the next milestone (2.1.0) which will includes a huge work about data ingestion performances. We already know that this is the one of the most important weakness of the platform right now! Do not hesitate to send us your feedbacks on our last releases!

We just released OpenCTI version 2.0.1! After the 2.0.0 some users reported us important bugs that are now fixed in this new version (especially on connectors & worker). We also introduced a persistent states in external import connectors such as MITRE or CVE to avoid re-sending messages to the queue each time the connector is restarted. Our work in the next milestones will be focused on improving the data ingestion speed and developing features to help users to massively handle entities and relationships in the platform (detect duplicates, merge, split, bulk delete, etc.).

## Version 2.0.0 (24/10/2019)
We are proud to announce a new major release of the OpenCTI platform: 2.0.0 is out! Although the documentation is still under construction, this new version brings many features and improvements to users. It allows you to store and manage files, add tags to entities, easily create relationships to relationships in reports, and, depending on the available connectors, enable automatic enrichment on observables, extraction of indicators in PDF files and exports in different formats. Several bugs have been fixed and multiple improvements made in display and performance. We are waiting for your feedback and future contributions, especially on connectors! 

#### :warning: Breaking changes :warning: 

##### New dependency
- To handle **file storage** for import, export and files linked to entities, **Minio** has been introduced in the OpenCTI stack as a required component. In the future, any S3 storage system will be able to store the OpenCTI data and files.
- The file management system can be used by connectors to extract intelligence such as IoCs, TTPs or store any export from the platform (generated PDFs, STIX2, etc.).

##### Workers and connectors
- There is now only one worker for writing data coming from the RabbitMQ broker on the platform, so **the `export` worker is deprecated**. The worker remain the same base code, the parameter `type` is no longer required.
- To handle import and export (only STIX2 for the moment), 2 [new connectors](https://github.com/OpenCTI-Platform/connectors) have been introduced.
- For the worker and connectors configuration, **the RabbitMQ parameters are no longer needed**, only the OpenCTI API hostname and token are required. RabbitMQ parameters are provided by the API through the Python helpers.

> The new configuration of connectors is available in the [dedicated documentation](https://opencti-platform.github.io/docs/installation/connectors).

## Version 1.1.0 (22/07/2019)
#### :warning: Breaking changes :warning: 

##### Integration and connectors
- **The integration process `connectors_scheduler.py` and the Docker image `opencti/integration` has been deleted and are no longer used**. This has been replaced by the [new connector architecture](https://opencti-platform.github.io/docs/development/connectors).
- **Connectors are no longer configured and enabled in the user interface**, you have to launch them independently, please see the dedicated documentation on [how to enable connectors](https://opencti-platform.github.io/docs/installation/connectors).

##### Default credentials and token

- **To launch the platform, you have to configure the default password and the default token of the platform**, either in your `docker-compose.yml` environment variables or in the `production.json` configuration file. If you do not configure these parameters, **the platform will not start and will raise an error**.
